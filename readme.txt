This repo contains all the source files required to generate .stl files for a 
cover for Mean Well power supplies. The cover gives space for the terminal 
blocks, as well as plenty of space for the cables. There is also enough room 
for other electronics to be placed inside if desired.

The cover mounts using two positioning holes to hold it in place and comes in 
two parts that will need to be glued together. The case is highly configurable, 
simply use the definitions.scad file for access to all the configurable 
variables.
